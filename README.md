# Innopolis 2024 - AI questionnaire

## What is it?

This repository contains simple Python library created by me and [Dmitry](https://github.com/glooomyeye) during "Mathematics in AI" summer camp by Yandex Education which took place in Innopolis University. The idea behind it is that you input a prompt like "You're happy" and get some nice plots as an output. It delivers 4 predefined psychological tests (all in Russian) and a basic agent for interacting with YandexGPT while also providing some level of extensibility.

## What's the point?

Human decisions are often strongly influenced by emotions, whereas LLM ones are strictly logical (not *that logical*, but *logical enough*). Although LLMs are able to understand emotions to some extent, it's hard to evaluate their ability to express them. So, during the camp, we chose to create a project around measuring how "emotionally aligned" different models are, based on different types of prompts they were given.

## Is there any demo data?

Sure! You can find plots generated by [demo.py](demo.py) (6 emotions with 6 ways to define each, all across 2 versions of YandexGPT) in [this Markdown file](demo_results/DEMO.md) (in Russian). Unfortunately, we decided to keep private both prompts (due to the fact that they were created by other team) and LLM answers.
